Material for MkDocs integrates with Mermaid.js , a very popular and flexible solution for drawing diagrams. Usage \u00b6 Using flowcharts \u00b6 Flowcharts are diagrams that represent workflows or processes. The steps are rendered as nodes of various kinds and are connected by edges, describing the necessary order of steps: Flow chart ``` mermaid graph LR A[Start] --> B{Error?}; B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]; C --> D[Debug]; D --> B; B ---->|No| E[Yay!]; ``` graph LR A[Start] --> B{Error?}; B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]; C --> D[Debug]; D --> B; B ---->|No| E[Yay!]; Using sequence diagrams \u00b6 Sequence diagrams describe a specific scenario as sequential interactions between multiple objects or actors, including the messages that are exchanged between those actors: Sequence diagram ``` mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John->>John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

John-->>Alice: Great! John->>Bob: How about you? Bob-->>John: Jolly good! Using state diagrams \u00b6 State diagrams are a great tool to describe the behavior of a system, decomposing it into a finite number of states, and transitions between those states: State diagram ``` mermaid stateDiagram-v2 state fork_state <<fork>> [*] --> fork_state fork_state --> State2 fork_state --> State3 state join_state <<join>> State2 --> join_state State3 --> join_state join_state --> State4 State4 --> [*] ``` stateDiagram-v2 state fork_state <<fork>> [*] --> fork_state fork_state --> State2 fork_state --> State3 state join_state <<join>> State2 --> join_state State3 --> join_state join_state --> State4 State4 --> [*] Using class diagrams \u00b6 Class diagrams are central to object oriented programing, describing the structure of a system by modelling entities as classes and relationships between them: Class diagram ``` mermaid classDiagram Person <|-- Student Person <|-- Professor Person : +String name Person : +String phoneNumber Person : +String emailAddress Person: +purchaseParkingPass() Address \"1\" <-- \"0..1\" Person:lives at class Student{ +int studentNumber +int averageMark +isEligibleToEnrol() +getSeminarsTaken() } class Professor{ +int salary } class Address{ +String street +String city +String state +int postalCode +String country -validate() +outputAsLabel() } ``` classDiagram Person <|-- Student Person <|-- Professor Person : +String name Person : +String phoneNumber Person : +String emailAddress Person: +purchaseParkingPass() Address \"1\" <-- \"0..1\" Person:lives at class Student{ +int studentNumber +int averageMark +isEligibleToEnrol() +getSeminarsTaken() } class Professor{ +int salary } class Address{ +String street +String city +String state +int postalCode +String country -validate() +outputAsLabel() } Using entity-relationship diagrams \u00b6 An entity-relationship diagram is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that exist between entities. It describes inter-related things in a specific domain of knowledge: Entity-relationship diagram ``` mermaid erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses ``` erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses Other diagram types \u00b6 Besides the diagram types listed above, Mermaid.js provides support for pie charts , gantt charts , user journeys , git graphs and requirement diagrams , all of which are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs.
